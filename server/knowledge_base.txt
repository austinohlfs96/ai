FAQ:
General Questions
Q: What is SpotSurfer?											
A: SpotSurfer is a parking management and reservation platform built for resort towns and mountain communities, helping drivers find reliable parking and helping property owners maximize their space.
Q: How does SpotSurfer work?
A: Simply choose your destination, select the date you want to park, and reserve your spot. You'll receive a confirmation with all the details.
Q: Where is SpotSurfer available?
A: Currently, we offer parking reservations in Vail and surrounding mountain communities. We are expanding, so stay tuned for new locations! Join our email newsletter to receive the latest updates!
Q: Why should I reserve a parking spot in advance?
A: Reserving ahead guarantees you a spot closer to the lifts, so you can skip the headache of circling for parking on busy days. It helps you avoid parking far from the action—or worse, having to walk or squeeze onto a crowded bus with all your gear. Booking early means less stress and more time on the mountain.
Q: How do I find my reserved parking spot?
A: All spots are shown on the map view in our reservation search page, and each listing includes an address with a direct link to Google Maps for directions.
A: After booking, you’ll receive a reservation confirmation email with detailed instructions on how to locate and access your spot, including any necessary access codes or valet info (if applicable).
Q: Is there a SpotSurfer mobile app?										
A: Yes! SpotSurfer is available on both iOS and Android. You can download the app from the App Store or Google Play to easily search, reserve, and manage your parking on the go.
Q: How does SpotSurfer help reduce traffic and congestion?	
A: By turning underused driveways and lots into reserved parking, SpotSurfer keeps cars out of the streets, reduces aimless circling, and streamlines access to trailheads and lifts. We're proud to partner with organizations like the Town of Vail, the Vail Police Department, and the Parking & Mobility Board to support smarter traffic flow.
 
 
Booking & Payment
Q: How do I pay for my parking reservation?
A: All payments are securely processed through Stripe. You can also pay using SpotSurfer Bucks, which are available at a discounted rate and can be used on any reservation. For frequent parkers, some locations also offer season passes and parking packs for extra savings.
Q: What are SpotSurfer Bucks and how do they work?						
A: SpotSurfer Bucks are credits that can be used toward any reservation on our platform. They're available at a discounted rate, and also issued as refunds for last-minute cancellations. You can apply them at checkout just like cash.
Q: Can I use multiple payment methods?								
A: Currently, we only accept one form of payment per transaction. If you have SpotSurfer Bucks, you can apply them at checkout, and pay any remaining balance with a credit/debit card or supported digital wallet.
Q: Can I modify or cancel my reservation?
A: Modifications are not currently supported, but you can cancel your existing reservation and book a new one with the desired changes.
   See our cancellation and refund policy below for details.
Q: What is the cancellation and refund policy?
A: Cancel 24+ hours in advance for a full refund to your original payment method.
A: Cancel within 24 hours and you’ll get a full refund in SpotSurfer Bucks for future use.
Q: Are there extra fees when booking a spot?
A: Nope! Our pricing is fully transparent—the price you see is the price you pay. There are no hidden fees, taxes, or surprise charges added at checkout.
 

 
 
Using Your Parking Spot
Q: How early can I arrive?
A: Most lots open at 6:00 AM, but exact hours vary by location. You’ll find the specific lot hours listed on the spot’s detail page and in your reservation confirmation. Just be sure to arrive during the posted open hours!
Q: What if someone is in my reserved spot?
A: Contact us immediately through the app or website, and we’ll assist you in finding an alternative spot or resolving the issue.
Q: What happens if I overstay my reservation?
A: SpotSurfer does not issue fines for overstaying, but each facility sets its own enforcement policy. Some may choose to boot or tow vehicles that stay beyond their reservation period, and any associated costs will be the responsibility of the vehicle owner. We recommend departing on time or reserving an extra day if you anticipate needing more time.
Q: Do I need to print my reservation?
A: No need! Just show your confirmation on your phone or follow the instructions for digital entry.
Q: Is my parking spot guaranteed?
A: Yes! Your reservation ensures you have a spot. If any issues arise, our support team is here to help.
 
 
 
Parking Lot & Security
Q: Are the parking lots secure?
A: We partner with trusted parking providers, many of whom offer security features such as cameras and attendants. However, we recommend not leaving valuables in your car.
Q: Are there electric vehicle (EV) charging spots?
A: SpotSurfer does not currently display EV charging availability on our listings. However, some valet locations may offer EV charging on a first-come, first-served basis. If EV charging is essential for your trip, we recommend reaching out to the facility directly to confirm availability.
Q: Are oversized vehicles (RVs, trailers, vans) allowed?                                                                   Some locations do allow oversized vehicles, but not all. Be sure to check the facility details on the spot listing to see if RVs, trailers, vans, or other large vehicles are permitted. If it’s not specified, we recommend reaching out to the facility before booking.
Q: Can I leave my car overnight?
A: Overnight parking availability varies by location. If available, it will be listed in the spot details.
 
 
 
 
Account & Support
Q: Do I need an account to book a spot?
A: No, you don’t need to create an account to reserve a spot—you can check out as a guest. However, we highly recommend creating an account, as it’s the only way to view, cancel, or manage your reservations after booking.
Q: I forgot my password. How do I reset it?
A: Click “Forgot Password” on the login page and enter your account email to be sent a link to reset your password.
Q: How do I contact SpotSurfer support?
A: You can reach us via email at info@spotsurfer.com, or by phone at (970) 389-4230.
 
 
Promotions & Discounts
Q: Does SpotSurfer offer promo codes?
A: Yes! Sign up for our newsletter and follow us on social media for exclusive deals and discount codes.
Q: Do you offer group or corporate parking reservations?

For Property Owners
Q: How do I sign up as a property owner?
A: SpotSurfer handles everything for you—from setting up your listing to managing reservations and payments. We create your listing, photograph your location, help set pricing, and market your spot to outdoor enthusiasts through our website, social media, and partnerships with local organizations like vail.gov. Setup typically takes about 3 days.
Q: How do property owners get paid?
A: SpotSurfer pays property owners on a monthly basis. For the fastest and most seamless experience, we recommend setting up a Stripe account for direct monthly deposits. If Stripe isn’t an option, owners can opt to receive a monthly check instead. Owners can also track their earnings and view all financial data related to their spot through their owner dashboard, which provides clear insights into revenue, reservations, and payout history.
Q: How do I know who is parking in my space?
A: All drivers are required to submit their personal and vehicle information when making a reservation. Property owners will receive a daily email with the details of that day's reservations, and can also view all upcoming and past bookings through their owner dashboard.
   Unauthorized vehicles are subject to booting or towing at the vehicle owner's expense, in accordance with local and state laws. SpotSurfer also provides free "SpotSurfer Parking Only" signage to help deter unauthorized use of your space.
Q: What if there’s damage or an issue?
A: SpotSurfer collects identifying information for every driver, which improves accountability. If damage occurs and a driver’s insurance doesn’t cover it, SpotSurfer carries liability and umbrella insurance to protect property owners from risks like physical damage, slip-and-fall incidents, or harm to adjacent property.
Q: Can I cancel as a property owner?
A: Absolutely. There's no long-term commitment. You can pause or cancel your account at any time if you're not satisfied.
 
Vail Parking Basics
Most Vail public garages (Vail Village & Lionshead) offer free parking after 3:00 PM in summer and some winter days (always check signs).

Overnight parking is not allowed in public garages unless arranged in advance.

Street parking overnight is prohibited and strictly enforced, especially during snowstorms.

RVs and trailers are not allowed in public garages.

Public garages do not allow in-and-out privileges unless specifically stated.

Prime busy times for parking are 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM on weekends, holidays, and powder days.

After 1:30 PM, parking availability improves across Vail.

Parking Trends & Timing Tips
Powder days create the worst traffic between 7:30 AM and 10:00 AM.

Sundays are typically less crowded than Saturdays.

Sunny, bluebird days also lead to full parking lots.

Early season (November) and late season (April) have the easiest parking.

Lionshead garage fills faster than Vail Village garage.

Free Town of Vail buses run regularly between Lionshead and Vail Village.

Winter Parking Reminders
Vail parking enforcement is strict — tickets are common for improper parking or expired tags.

Overnight snow bans apply to street parking even if it’s not snowing.

West Vail lots are more affordable but require using the shuttle or bus.

Hotel valet pricing increases during holiday periods and peak weekends.

Helpful Local Parking Tips

The closest parking to Eagle Bahn Gondola is Arrabelle Valet or The Hythe.

Evergreen Lodge is the most budget-friendly SpotSurfer lot near Lionshead.
